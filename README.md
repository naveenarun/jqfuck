## About JQFuck

JQFuck creates working code from your Javascript.

jQuery has long been known as the plugin of choice for routine JS operations. Recent developments have led to the creation of rich content libraries enabling variable manipulation via jQuery, thus allowing for the development and deployment of sophisticated, DRY web applications.

JQFuck represents a postmodern shift from DRY to RY. As a futuristic and educational programming style, it is based on the atomic parts of JavaScript and is implemented only with jQuery calls and six non-alphanumeric characters.

So now, you can transpile **any** Javascript code into **pure, delicious jQuery**. A dream come true!
